Regarding Spring Boot Testing (Data Layer)

Spring Boot provides the @DataJpaTest annotation to test the persistence layer components.

It scans the @Entity classes and Spring Data JPA repositories.

Sets the spring.jpa.show-sql property to true and enable the SQL queries logging.

By Default, JPA test data are transactional and roll back at the end of each test; it means we do not need to clean up saved or modified table data after each test.

Replace the application data source, run and configure the embedded database on classpath.


By default they will autoconfigure in-memory embedded database for testing purposes.
eg H2 database

But if you don't want to replace your original database by test database ,use
@AutoConfigureTestDatabase(replace = Replace.NONE)

Since test cases should not modify the state of DB , by default rollback is applied after the execution of test cases.

But , since we wanted to write test cases to insert the recs in emps table , marked 
@Rollback(false)

@DataJpaTest annotation doesn’t load other Spring beans (@Components, @Controller, @Service, and annotated beans) into ApplicationContext(SC) 

By default, it scans for @Entity classes and configures Spring Data JPA repositories annotated with @Repository annotation.

2. Spring Boot provides 
@SpringBootTest for integration testing
(eg : service +dao + DB)
