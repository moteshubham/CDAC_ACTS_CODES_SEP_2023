Create a Class Employee with the following specifications

Properties
----------
string Name -> no blank names should be allowed
int EmpNo ->  must be readonly and autogenerated
decimal Basic -> must be between some range
short DeptNo -> must be > 0

Methods
-------
decimal GetNetSalary() -> returns calculated net salary (Use any formula to get net salary based on Basic salary)


Create constructors to accept initial values for Employee obj
Employee o1 = new Employee("Amol",123465, 10);
Employee o2 = new Employee("Amol",123465);
Employee o3 = new Employee("Amol");
Employee o4 = new Employee();

EmpNo must be autogenerated ... i.e.
first object should automatically get EmpNo 1
second object should automatically get EmpNo 2
third object should automatically get EmpNo 3
...and so on...

Test Cases
Employee o1 = new Employee()
Employee o2 = new Employee()
Employee o3 = new Employee()
cw(o1.EmpNo)
cw(o2.EmpNo)
cw(o3.EmpNo)

cw(o3.EmpNo)
cw(o2.EmpNo)
cw(o1.EmpNo)
